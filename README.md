Smart Cards is a flashcard creation app. This app allows users to view publicly available flashcard sets or to signup/login and create their own custom sets of flashcards. The app also tracks a logged-in userâ€™s self-reported success or failure upon viewing cards and uses a simple spaced repetition algorithm to show cards that have been answered correctly with less frequency as time goes by.

This app is my first attempt at creating a project with a backend. It uses Node.js, Express.js, EJS, Mongoose and MongoDB.

How it works: The home page displays publically available flashcard sets as well as sets authored by the currently logged-in user. Sets are listed by subject, subcategory and title, with the title being a clickable link to a details page that allows the user to study that particular set. The details view first displays a set card that contains the set information including subcategory, title, author and the number of cards that the user has to study in the set. The user can click a button to begin viewing the cards in the set or, if they are the author of the set, can click a button to edit the set information for all of the cards in the set. 
If the user clicks to view the cards, cards are displayed one at a time with the question (or card-front) face-up first. A button allows the user to flip the card and view the answer. The card-back also displays a "nailed it!" button and a "blew it!" button that can be clicked to initiate smart functionality for that particular card and user. 
Smart functionality tracks successful views indicated by the user by saving the card ID, last successful view and consecutive successful views to the logged-in user object. A simple spaced repetition algorithm decides which cards the user should study and when so that when a particular set of cards is requested, cards that have recently been answered correctly will be pulled out of the set for a number of days that correlates with the number of consecutive successful views. 
Edit views allow users to edit the set information for an entire set of cards or the information for individual cards for cards that they authored. 
A create view also allows users to create new sets and cards and indicate if they would like to make the set publicly available. Publicly available sets can be viewed by anyone who uses the app but only logged in users may create new sets and edit thier own sets. 
Login and signup pages allow new and returning users to create flashcard sets and track their learning.

Next steps:  
This is very much a first draft version. I chose to keep my models simple because I am new to backend programming. I created only a Card model and a User model. This has proved problematic and resulted in some overly-complicated code in the controllers and views. I hope to reorganize my approach beginning with adding a Set model which holds references to the cards belonging to that specific set. Fetching sets of cards from the database will be much easier and less costly than searching through every card in order to assemble each set as they are requested. This will create a cascade of necessary changes in the views and routes but will ultimately reduce the conmplexity and verbosity of the code as it stands. 

What I learned and what I still need to learn: 

I definitely got my feet wet with backend concepts such as templating engines, routing, MVC and Mongoose/MongoDb. I understand the basics of HTTP requests, how to pass a variable in a url and use it in a controller to query a database. I also know a bit about passing data returned from a query to the rest of the app. I also gained a much clearer understanding of what the function of a model is and, by extension, the functionality that an ORM provides. 

I am still struggling to understand the best methods for accessing database objects in both the backend and frontend code. At times I wanted to reference an object from the database in my frontend JS but only knew how to pass the data to EJS, place it in a hidden HTML tag and then use querySelector to access it in my JS. Surely there is a better way!?

I also need to learn how to create a nested model in order to make the changes to the code that I mentioned above in the "next steps" section.
